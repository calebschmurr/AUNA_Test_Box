Project Status and Goals:


General TODO:
 - Create an install file - compile a list of 
 Python libraries required.






Goal for 4/6/21:
 - Update the Serial Communication System - make it faster, use a different baud rate,
 read up on Arduino site about Serial comms.
 (DONE) - Serial is made faster.


Added full reset command (DONE)
- need to add protocol for disconnecting and reconnecting to Elegoo on reset.

Relay_Test runs correctly.
Make sure tests are closed, and box is reset after running a test.

4/6/21 Timecard: 9:00 AM - 11:05 AM.
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM


4/7/21 Timecard: 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM
Goals:
 - Finish Diagramming (1 hour) 8AM-9AM.  This took all morning.
 - Make sure tests are closed on test Finish (30 min) (Done)
 - Create methods/protocol for connecting/disconnecting from Elegoo (3 hrs) (DONE)
1:30 - 2:30 PM
3:00PM to 5:00 PM

TODO: Fix the Pin Checking error on the Relay Test example.

Design the voltage divider for digital and analog input from 12V down to 5V.
Design the inner test box, wiring.
Design a box in Solidworks for the system.

Test the system w/ 12V Supply.

Look at certain connectors. (DONE - connectors chosen.)

4/8/21: 9:30 AM - 3:00 PM

CHANGES Required:

 - Pins X1_1 through X1_12 are now input only.
 - Pinx X1_13 through X1_18 are now output only.
 - Validate that Pins X2_1 through X2_8 are output only.

 - Update the Test Creation process to accomodate for the input changes:
  - Make the program detect when to send the input and output commands.

DONE:
 - Changed the Test Creation Menu
  - Chagned the test creation process to display properly.
 - Fixed the Pin Check Code Issue.

  TODO: Fix the issue with not adjusting the serial port input when the Serial object
  is connected.
  When Refresh Serial is hit in the main menu, it doesn't adjust the PinControlUI Serial port.

 - Fix reset on Arduino:  Add ability to clear list, and reset all outputs.



6/9/21:

TODO:
Focus on documentation.  Document how the Computer App Software is organized.
Design software so there is always only one PinList.  Every change to pin Status
makes a change on the Master PinList, which is stored within PinControlUI.
[Done]


6/10/21:

TODO:
Analyze Computer software - make sure it follows software standards laid out in
flowchart.

Go through the test creation - make sure all standards are followed. [Done]

Go through test modification - make sure all standards are followed, works thoroughly. [Done]

Go through test testing - make sure all standards are followed. [Started]


Done:
 - Went through MainWindowUI.onNewTestNextStage
  - Went through MainWindowUI.testCreatorLoadInValues()
   - Added in image resizing on selecting and saving an image.

- Changed getTestPinsList to reflect new standards
- Went through MainWindowUI.onCreateNewTest
   - went through MainWindowUI.getTestPinsList()

   -Went through MainWindowUI.enableModifyTestPins()
   - Went through MainWindowUI.setNewTestCreatorPins()
 - Determine where test pins are initially loaded, make sure it fits
 new standard.

  - Go through ModifyTestPushed
  - Go through MainWindowUI.loadTestSequence
  - Go through testsequence.initialLoadIn

  - Fix the image resizing - keep the aspect ratio, fit to 500 x 250. [Done]

  -NEXT STEP:  Fix the loading of the test.
   - Lots of bugs with saving on next stage.  Make sure the MasterPinsList
   gets updated properly on saving the next test stage.  Lots of issues with this.
   Issues are particularly with the Analog pins that have a check code.  Fix this.

   6/16/21:
   On next stage hit - update the expected value and check code
   for each pin
   based on the value filled out in the NewTestCreator tab

  -----
  Currently the masterPinsList updates for X1_17 and the X2 pins, but
  not for the X1_13 and X1_14.  Fix this.  Done.
  ----
  Check codes are still not updating for Analog Input pins. fix this.  (Fixed.)
  Pin 24, the X2_3 did not change to 'On' status.  Fix this. (Is it supposed to be like this?)
  Also, Pin X1_17 thinks it is pin 6. Fix this.  Make sure the ConnectorToPin function returns proper values based on the Pin Setup page of Software_Flowchart. [Done]

----
Just pressed modify test - got error.
Fix how the test is being saved - the pins are saved in two levels of a json file.  Fix this.

---
Fix the image being drawn in.  The image does not show up on Modify test pushed.
Make sure it loads the image properly. (Done).

Also, make sure the Check_Code gets updated properly for Analog Inputs. (Done)
----
On loading test, fix the problem with TestSequence having no attribute
TestPinsList.

Left off on loading test for actual testing and issues with that.

6/17/21:

On failing to load a test for modifying, make sure the system clears
variables and goes back to mode 0. [I think this is done - needs verification.]

 Fix the UpdateUI_Inputs.
 Basically, go through the PinControlUI and make sure
 all the methods match the new standard of using the MasterPinList. [Done]
	Learned that SerialComm has it's own PinList.  Remove this PinList, and force
	it to use the MasterPinList instead. [Done]

- Fix bug in getPinExpectedValue().  Determine what format self.testPins is in for TestSequence TestStage class.
It's a dict object.  Fix this. [Done].

Updated the Arduino software and flashed to MEGA.

On finishing test, gets the ListindexOutOfRange error. fix this.
This is because the UpdateUI thread is still called sometimes after the thread has been killed due to the 1/4 second pause.
Not sure how to account for this.

PinList::parseInputInfo - error parsing input.  Gets the error-retrying later message. fix this.

Fixed the Arduino Resetting the pins. [Done]

When 'Clear All Values' inside New Test Creator tab is pushed, throws an error. Fix this.

6/21/21:

Goals:
Fix the DS3502 chips [done]
Compile a list of libraries/requirements. [Done]

Install on one of the outside computers, run a test.

Demonstrate a test.

Fix the issues with load test.

Install the current sensor, hook it up to power.


  - When performing pin check, the current_value is not getting updated
  from serial line input.  Make sure the MasterPinList is getting
  updated. [Done]
   - On loading the test next stage, the check code is not being loaded 
	into the MasterPinList. Fix this. [Done].

 - ON creating new tests, the description is saved as the test name.  Fix this. [Fixed]

  - If there is an error creating the test, it saves the folder but not the file.  Make sure the folder is deleted.

   - Un-Invert the On/Off for X2.  [Fixed.]
