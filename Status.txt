Project Status and Goals:

Goal for 4/6/21:
 - Update the Serial Communication System - make it faster, use a different baud rate,
 read up on Arduino site about Serial comms.
 (DONE) - Serial is made faster.


Added full reset command (DONE)
- need to add protocol for disconnecting and reconnecting to Elegoo on reset.

Relay_Test runs correctly.
Make sure tests are closed, and box is reset after running a test.

4/6/21 Timecard: 9:00 AM - 11:05 AM.
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM


4/7/21 Timecard: 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM
Goals:
 - Finish Diagramming (1 hour) 8AM-9AM.  This took all morning.
 - Make sure tests are closed on test Finish (30 min) (Done)
 - Create methods/protocol for connecting/disconnecting from Elegoo (3 hrs) (DONE)
1:30 - 2:30 PM
3:00PM to 5:00 PM

TODO: Fix the Pin Checking error on the Relay Test example.

Design the voltage divider for digital and analog input from 12V down to 5V.
Design the inner test box, wiring.
Design a box in Solidworks for the system.

Test the system w/ 12V Supply.

Look at certain connectors. (DONE - connectors chosen.)

4/8/21: 9:30 AM - 3:00 PM

CHANGES Required:

 - Pins X1_1 through X1_12 are now input only.
 - Pinx X1_13 through X1_18 are now output only.
 - Validate that Pins X2_1 through X2_8 are output only.

 - Update the Test Creation process to accomodate for the input changes:
  - Make the program detect when to send the input and output commands.

DONE:
 - Changed the Test Creation Menu
  - Chagned the test creation process to display properly.
