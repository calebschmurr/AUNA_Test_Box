Project Status and Goals:

Goal for 4/6/21:
 - Update the Serial Communication System - make it faster, use a different baud rate,
 read up on Arduino site about Serial comms.
 (DONE) - Serial is made faster.


Added full reset command (DONE)
- need to add protocol for disconnecting and reconnecting to Elegoo on reset.

Relay_Test runs correctly.
Make sure tests are closed, and box is reset after running a test.

4/6/21 Timecard: 9:00 AM - 11:05 AM.
2:30 PM - 3:30 PM


4/7/21 Timecard: 8:00 AM - 10:30 AM
Goals:
 - Finish Diagramming (1 hour) 8AM-9AM.  This took all morning.
 - Make sure tests are closed on test Finish (30 min) (Done)
 - Create methods/protocol for connecting/disconnecting from Elegoo (3 hrs) (DONE)
1:30 - 2:30 PM
3:00PM to 5:00 PM

TODO: Fix the Pin Checking error on the Relay Test example.

Design the voltage divider for digital and analog input from 12V down to 5V.
Design the inner test box, wiring.
Design a box in Solidworks for the system.

Test the system w/ 12V Supply.

Look at certain connectors. (DONE - connectors chosen.)

4/8/21: 9:30 AM - 3:00 PM

CHANGES Required:

 - Pins X1_1 through X1_12 are now input only.
 - Pinx X1_13 through X1_18 are now output only.
 - Validate that Pins X2_1 through X2_8 are output only.

 - Update the Test Creation process to accomodate for the input changes:
  - Make the program detect when to send the input and output commands.

DONE:
 - Changed the Test Creation Menu
  - Chagned the test creation process to display properly.
 - Fixed the Pin Check Code Issue.

  TODO: Fix the issue with not adjusting the serial port input when the Serial object
  is connected.
  When Refresh Serial is hit in the main menu, it doesn't adjust the PinControlUI Serial port.

 - Fix reset on Arduino:  Add ability to clear list, and reset all outputs.



6/9/21:

TODO:
Focus on documentation.  Document how the Computer App Software is organized.
Design software so there is always only one PinList.  Every change to pin Status
makes a change on the Master PinList, which is stored within PinControlUI.
[Done]


6/10/21:

TODO:
Analyze Computer software - make sure it follows software standards laid out in
flowchart.

Go through the test creation - make sure all standards are followed. [Done]

Go through test modification - make sure all standards are followed, works thoroughly. [Done]

Go through test testing - make sure all standards are followed. [Started]


Done:
 - Went through MainWindowUI.onNewTestNextStage
  - Went through MainWindowUI.testCreatorLoadInValues()
   - Added in image resizing on selecting and saving an image.

- Changed getTestPinsList to reflect new standards
- Went through MainWindowUI.onCreateNewTest
   - went through MainWindowUI.getTestPinsList()

   -Went through MainWindowUI.enableModifyTestPins()
   - Went through MainWindowUI.setNewTestCreatorPins()
 - Determine where test pins are initially loaded, make sure it fits
 new standard.

  - Go through ModifyTestPushed
  - Go through MainWindowUI.loadTestSequence
  - Go through testsequence.initialLoadIn

  - Fix the image resizing - keep the aspect ratio, fit to 500 x 250. [Done]

  -NEXT STEP:  Fix the loading of the test.
   - Lots of bugs with saving on next stage.  Make sure the MasterPinsList
   gets updated properly on saving the next test stage.  Lots of issues with this.
   Issues are particularly with the Analog pins that have a check code.  Fix this.
